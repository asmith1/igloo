Igloo is an original personal project that I almost entirely made over winter break.

It allows the user to enter connections into the program, and will then tell the 
user who all of their second order connections are, based on the other connections 
saved in the program.

I used a dictionary to save connections for easy look-up, and I used sets to store
the connections to avoid repeats.
